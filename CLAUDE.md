## Architecture

**nanobot** is an ultra-lightweight AI agent framework (~2,000 lines of core agent code). It receives messages from chat platforms, processes them through an LLM with tool execution, and streams responses back.

### Message Flow

```
Chat Channel → MessageBus → AgentLoop → AgentRegistry → LLMProvider → ToolRegistry → MessageBus → Chat Channel
```

Messages (`InboundMessage`, `OutboundMessage`) use the `Address` interface (channel name + path segments). `AgentLoop` (`nanobot/agent/loop.py`) is the core orchestrator, which now leverages an optional `AgentRegistry`. It uses the registry to pull specialized Runners/Providers, or uses an explicitly supplied one. Message dispatch is split into `_process_system_message()` and `_process_user_message()` with a shared `_make_progress_callback()` factory for bus publishing. After each turn, `MemoryConsolidator` stages deltas to `STAGING.md` (non-destructive pipeline).

### Key Packages

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `nanobot/agent/` | Core agent: loop, context building, memory, tools, subagents |
| `nanobot/providers/` | LLM backends (Anthropic, OpenAI-compat, Azure, OAuth) |
| `nanobot/channels/` | Chat platform integrations (12 platforms) |
| `nanobot/bus/` | Async message queue between channels and agent |
| `nanobot/session/` | Per-conversation history (JSONL append-only) |
| `nanobot/config/` | Pydantic config schema + workspace path resolution |
| `nanobot/cli/` | Typer CLI (`agent`, `gateway`, `onboard`, `status`, etc.) |
| `nanobot/skills/` | Bundled skills. Other skills are loaded from `~/.nanobot/workspace/skills/` |

### Provider System

`nanobot/providers/registry.py` is the single source of truth for 25+ providers. Each `ProviderSpec` defines name, keywords, `env_key`, default API base, and capability flags. Additional fields on `ProviderSpec`:
- `is_local: bool` — disables timeout retries (local providers should fail fast, not retry)
- `http_timeout: int` — per-provider HTTP timeout in seconds (default 120; local providers use 600)
- `max_concurrent: int` — max simultaneous requests (0 = unlimited; local providers use 1 to serialize)
- `strip_model_prefix: bool` — strip `"provider/"` routing prefix before sending model name to API

**To add a new provider**: (1) add a `ProviderSpec` to `PROVIDERS` in `registry.py`, (2) add a config field to `ProvidersConfig` in `nanobot/config/schema.py`.

Backend implementations include: `AnthropicProvider`, `OpenAICompatProvider`, `AzureOpenAIProvider`, and `GeminiNativeProvider`. A special `FallbackProvider` wraps these, providing quota-awareness and automatic fallback chains that reset daily.

**FallbackProvider failure modes:**
- **Quota exhaustion** → permanent slot advance (`self._active_index`); next reset scheduled per `quota_reset_timezone`
- **Connectivity/timeout on local slot** → request-scoped fallback only (`effective_index`); next request retries the local provider first

**Provider resolution** (`nanobot/config/schema.py`): `_match_provider` and all public resolution methods (`get_provider`, `get_api_base`, etc.) accept an explicit `provider_override` parameter. When `provider_override == "auto"`, resolution first checks `agent_config.provider` before falling back to keyword-based model matching. Pass `mc.provider` when resolving per-slot settings to avoid agent-level defaults leaking into per-model lookups. Note: `llama`/`llama.cpp` are NOT in inferencia's keywords (removed to prevent false-positive detection on `llama3.2`, etc.).

### Tool System

`nanobot/agent/tools/registry.py` holds `ToolRegistry`. Built-in tools: file operations, shell exec, web search/fetch, message sending, subagent spawn, cron scheduling, and MCP. File/shell tools respect `restrictToWorkspace` config to sandbox access.

**ExecTool safety guard** (`nanobot/agent/tools/shell.py`):
- Blocks dangerous patterns (rm -rf, dd, format, shutdown, fork bombs).
- Detects internal/private URLs via DNS resolution before execution.
- When `restrictToWorkspace` is enabled, extracts absolute paths from commands and blocks paths outside the working directory.
- **Slash command whitelist:** Known slash commands (`/new`, `/restart`, `/RIP`, etc.) are filtered from path extraction to prevent false-positive workspace guard blocks (e.g., `echo "/new"` must not be mistaken for accessing `/new` filesystem path).

### Subagent System

The `SubagentManager` (`nanobot/agent/subagent.py`) handles background task execution. Subagents are spawned via the `spawn` tool and run in a separate `AgentRunner` instance. The `spawn` tool dynamically documents available agent profiles (e.g., `fast`, `deep`, `balanced`), enabling the main agent to autonomously select the appropriate model. Subagents inherit the workspace context (`SOUL.md`, `USER.md`, `SUBAGENT.md`) and report back to the main agent through the `MessageBus` upon completion.

### Memory System

Three-layer staging architecture:
- **`STAGING.md`** — Transient scratchpad. `MemoryConsolidator` appends deltas here after each turn (non-destructive).
- **`MEMORY.md`** — Long-term invariants. Updated via manual synthesis (`memory-synthesize` skill) which reads from staging.
- **`HISTORY.md`** — Append-only timestamped log. Searchable via grep-style tools.

`MemoryConsolidator` appends incremental updates to `STAGING.md` after each turn (never overwrites `MEMORY.md` directly). Strict truncation protection (`finish_reason == "length"`) prevents corrupting STAGING.md/HISTORY.md. Periodic `memory-synthesize` skill reads from staging to update `MEMORY.md`. It uses the loop's own provider (full fallback chain) and the provider's configured `max_tokens`. Messages are never modified after writing (cache-friendly for prompt caching).

### Skill System

`SkillsLoader` scans `~/.nanobot/workspace/skills/` for directories containing `SKILL.md`. Some skills are `always_skills` (always loaded into context); others are on-demand. Bundled skills live in `nanobot/skills/`.

### Command System

Built-in slash commands are registered in `nanobot/command/builtin.py`. The `/status` command is a consolidated dashboard providing system uptime, token usage, context estimation, and active background tasks. Commands like `/new`, `/repl`, and `/restart` manage session lifecycle and development operations. The `/repl` command allows executing arbitrary Python code for debugging and system management. For security, it is restricted to users listed in `repl.allowUsers` (default: `["cli:user"]`). Access can be granted to other users using the format `"channel:sender_id"` (e.g., `"tg:12345678"`).

### Channel Integration (Telegram)

The Telegram channel implementation supports advanced interaction modes:
- **Topics as Sessions:** Threads/Topics represent isolated `Address` contexts (`tg://chat_id/topic_id`).
- **Profile Pinning:** Frugal profile switching is natively supported via pinned messages containing `Profile: <profile_name>`.
- **Audit Trails:** Progress/Status is streamed into a live message with proactive rollover (creating new messages gracefully before hitting Telegram's 4096-character limit).

## Configuration

User config normally lives at `~/.nanobot/config.json` but when run as service via systemd, it's mapped from `/etc/nanobot/config.json`
The workspace (agent files, memory, skills) defaults to `~/.nanobot/workspace/`.

## Testing Conventions

- All async tests use `pytest-asyncio` with `asyncio_mode = "auto"` (set in `pyproject.toml`)
- Tests live in `tests/` mirroring the source structure
- Integration tests hit real code paths; avoid mocking internals

## Deployment Architecture

Production environments use a symlink-based worktree architecture:
- **Workspace:** `~/.nanobot/workspace`
- **Active Code:** Symlink `~/.nanobot/workspace/current` points to a specific Git worktree (e.g., `nanobot-dev`, `nanobot-main`).
- **Service:** `nanobot.service` runs the gateway using the virtual environment inside the `current` symlink.
- **Environment Overrides:** Managed via `~/.nanobot/workspace/nanobot.env` (e.g., `EXTRA_ARGS` for config overlays).
- **Lifecycle Logging:** Restarts/shutdowns log intents to `~/.nanobot/workspace/logs/lifecycle.log`. The bot processes read this log on boot to report success to the user.

## Branching

`dev` is the working branch in the `workspace/nanobot-dev` worktree -- agents should perform all work in the worktree.
Actual repository root is at `workspace/nanobot-repo` -- user handles merging from `dev` to `staging` and/or `main`.
- remote `origin` links to user's own repository.
